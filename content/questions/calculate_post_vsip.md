Title: How to calculate a specific post-closing VSIP-Pool?

## Question

The investors insist that, in the course of the first financing round of the company (that currently has no employee incentive program), a pool of virtual shares is created. The number of virtual shares under this pool is intended to represent 10% of the fully-diluted share capital of the company post-closing. How can the number of virtual shares be calculated?

## Answer

The most intuitive, non-circular way to calculate the number of virtual shares that form a virtual share pool of a certain percentage requires knowledge of the following key terms of the transaction:

- the pre-money valuation of the company,
- the total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round, and
- the current share capital of the company (prior to the financing round).

On that basis, the required number of virtual shares to represent a certain percentage of the fully-diluted share capital post-closing can be deduced from the following steps:

1. The pre-money valuation plus the total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round equals the so-called post-money valuation of the company.

2. The total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round divided by the post-money valuation of the company (see no. 1) equals the share percentage the investors will acquire for their investment in the course of the financing round.

3. The shareholding percentage the investors will acquire for their investment in the course of the financing round (see no. 2) __plus__ the intended (percentage) size of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) yields __the total post-closing percentage that will be issued in the course of the financing round__.

4. 100% minus the total post-closing percentage that will be issued in the course of the financing round (see no. 3) equals __the share percentage the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing__.

5. Since the share percentage that the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing is known (see no. 4), it is possible to calculate __the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing__. For this, one has to multiply the current share capital of the company with 100% and divide the outcome of this calculation by the share percentage the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing (see no. 4).

6. The __total number of virtual shares the virtual share pool will consist of__ equals the intended percentage of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) out of the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing. In other words: the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing needs to be divided by 100 and the outcome of this calculation multiplied with the intended percentage of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) equals the total number of virtual shares the virtual share pool.
