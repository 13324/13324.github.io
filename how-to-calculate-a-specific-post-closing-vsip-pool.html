      <h2>Question</h2>
<p>The investors insist that, in the course of the first financing round of the company (that currently has no employee incentive program), a pool of virtual shares is created. The number of virtual shares under this pool is intended to represent 10% of the fully-diluted share capital of the company post-closing. How can the number of virtual shares be calculated?</p>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p>The most intuitive, non-circular way to calculate the number of virtual shares that form a virtual share pool of a certain percentage requires knowledge of the following key terms of the transaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>the pre-money valuation of the company,</li>
<li>the total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round, and</li>
<li>the current share capital of the company (prior to the financing round).</li>
</ul>
<p>On that basis, the required number of virtual shares to represent a certain percentage of the fully-diluted share capital post-closing can be deduced from the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The pre-money valuation plus the total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round equals the so-called post-money valuation of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The total amount invested by the investors in the course of the financing round divided by the post-money valuation of the company (see no. 1) equals the share percentage the investors will acquire for their investment in the course of the financing round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shareholding percentage the investors will acquire for their investment in the course of the financing round (see no. 2) <strong>plus</strong> the intended (percentage) size of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) yields <strong>the total post-closing percentage that will be issued in the course of the financing round</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% minus the total post-closing percentage that will be issued in the course of the financing round (see no. 3) equals <strong>the share percentage the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since the share percentage that the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing is known (see no. 4), it is possible to calculate <strong>the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing</strong>. For this, one has to multiply the current share capital of the company with 100% and divide the outcome of this calculation by the share percentage the current share capital of the company will represent post-closing (see no. 4).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>total number of virtual shares the virtual share pool will consist of</strong> equals the intended percentage of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) out of the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing. In other words: the number of shares that will represent 100% of the (fully-diluted) share capital post-closing needs to be divided by 100 and the outcome of this calculation multiplied with the intended percentage of the virtual share pool (in the example: 10%) equals the total number of virtual shares the virtual share pool.</p>
